Unfortunately, these kinds of issues don't show up on Nessus scans, so we write exploits. Please use this code responsibly.\r\n\r\n## Projects ##\r\n\r\n[JackIt](https://github.com/insecurityofthings/jackit) -- MouseJack POC\r\n\r\n_This is a partial implementation of Bastille's MouseJack exploit. See [mousejack.com](https://www.mousejack.com) for more details. Full credit goes to [Bastille's team](https://www.bastille.net/meet-mousejack-researchers) for discovering this issue and writing the libraries to work with the CrazyRadio PA dongle. Also, thanks to Samy Kamkar for [KeySweeper](http://samy.pl/keysweeper/), to Thorsten Schroeder and Max Moser for their work on [KeyKeriki](http://www.remote-exploit.org/articles/keykeriki_v2_0__8211_2_4ghz/) and to [Travis Goodspeed](http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.ca/2011/02/promiscuity-is-nrf24l01s-duty.html). We stand on the shoulders of giants._\r\n\r\n## Who ##\r\nWe work in the security industry and often it is necessary to demonstrate risk in order to create action. These implementations where written by [phikshun](https://github.com/phikshun) and [infamy](https://github.com/infamy).\r\n",
